Mastodon is a open source twitter like social media platform.
It is, by far, the biggest open source social media right now.
It has a main server, mastodon.social. That helps Mastodon by getting a lot of people in one server, making people interact with each other more.

Pros[+]:
-It is the biggest platform, at the time.
-It is twitter styled, that prevents echo-chambers.
-It has a one big main server, instead of bunch of little ones. You can use it more like a social media and less like a forum.
-Modern design and user interface.
-Excellent cross-platform support.

Cons[-]:
-User base is not that great right now. Open source software tends to attract a lot of weird people too, unfortunately.
