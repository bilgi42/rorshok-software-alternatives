Lemmy is a open source social media/forum platform.
It currently has 575 servers and 48K active users.
Servers are self hosted and maintained/moderated by the creators/admins of the servers.

Pros[+]:
-The protocol is open sourced, It is rare to see in social medias.
-The forum style. A lot of social media try to copy Twitter style. There's nothing wrong with it but forums are needed too, spesifically for todays social media culture.
-Active userbase, with 48K people, and growing, you can find people with your similar interests in no time.

Cons[-]:
-Because it is a forum styled social media, this some time leads to echo-chambers. They can be positive, or negative but either way echo-chambers are toxic.
-The old reddit style user interface may scare some people of, it looks outdated.
