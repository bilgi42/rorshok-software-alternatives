LunarVim is a neovim based text editor.
It is an attempt to IDEify neovim, with minimal effort.


Pros[-]:
-Gives a lot of vim freedom without configuring it.
-Really good extension support.
-Blazingly fast when combined with a fast terminal editor, like alacritty.
-Uses a lot less resources when compared to VSCode and a lot other code editors.

Cons[-]:
-New users may struggle with vim logic.
-It is not out of the box usable as it claims to be, I don't blame them for that but downloading Hack fonts and setting language servers for every language is not the most easiest experience.
-It feels a lot like a text editor, more than a code editor. It doesn't show errors in code, it doesn't have a debugging tool and a code running tool out of the box.
